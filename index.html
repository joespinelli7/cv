        <p><em>Web Developer</em> <a href="https://www.hidglobal.com/" target="_blank" <strong>HID Global</strong></a></p>
        <p>Full stack web developer with a passion for constant learning, finding efficient solutions to issues, and sports. Experience in JavaScript, ReactJS, Ruby on Rails, and a background in Mechanical Engineering. I collaborate well with others
          to work towards achieving a unified goal as part of a team. My background in engineering helps with problem solving while my experience in the food industry allows me to think and act quickly. I was drawn to the world of code by the fact
          that there are always new things to learn, challenges to overcome and the ability to create amazing applications to help others. </p>
